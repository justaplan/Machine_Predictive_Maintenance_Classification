# Machine_Predictive_Maintenance_Classification
Capstone project for Elite Data Science Certification

1. Project Name: Machine Predictive Maintenance Classification
2. Deliverable: Executable Model Scipt
3. Machine Learning Task: Classification
3. Target Variable: Target - 0 (No Failure) & 1 (Failure)
4. Input Features: See Data Dictionary
6. Win Condition: N/A (Best Possible Model)

In Summary:

This topic of the project is predict the machine failure by the the list of machine technical information. The dataset is download from the kaggle link, the url is inside the "data dictionary.pdf". The most important thing is identify potential machine going to breakdown so user can arrange necessary the preventive maintenance before breakdown.
